# Project Description

This repository contains the scripts used to replicate parts of the results in the paper "A comprehensive study design reveals treatment- and transcript abundance–dependent concordance between RNA-seq and microarray data". This project is divided into three parts: data curator, programmer, and analyst. It contains the bash code and R code that was used to pre-process and analyze the down-stream data.
